            We are extremely satisfied with our collaboration. Yellow Brick Road
            demonstrated an excellent understanding of our business needs,
            coupled with outstanding headhunting skills and expertise. They
            played a pivotal role in our company&#39;s transformation by
            recruiting nearly half of our entire workforce. Without their
            support, we would not have been able to achieve our business goals,
            significantly improve product development quality, or initiate our
            international expansion efforts. They have proven to be trustworthy,
            professional, and incredibly effective.

            For me, it's crucial that the recruiter provides candidate profiles
            tailored to my needs, rather than those that are simply "available
            at the moment." Yellow Brick Road demonstrated a strong
            understanding of my candidate requirements, excellent communication,
            and effective process integration. When necessary, we also had the
            opportunity to discuss "intangible" aspects, such as cultural fit
            and the candidate's personality. This was valuable to me as it
            provided an additional perspective on the individual.

            Throughout all the cooperation, Kacper and his associates proved
            they&#39;re reliable partners. Showed a high level of engagement and
            effort to understand our recruitment needs. Also, they presented
            themselves as capable of being flexible when a rapidly changing
            situation required it. Their support in hiring people for tech,
            product and leadership positions was something that we really
            appreciated.

            I had the pleasure of working with Kacper on one of the key
            recruitments to the TECH team. I was very impressed with his
            professionalism, extensive subject knowledge, commitment and support
            provided. Also the ability to consult on market trend issues outside
            of the project.
